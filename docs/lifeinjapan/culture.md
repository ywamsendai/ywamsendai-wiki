# Japanese Culture

Whether this is your first time to Japan, or you have lived here for a while, it is always good to keep in mind some aspects of Japanese culture so we can better love and serve the Japanese people. Below you will find a few cultural pointers for your life in Japan.

## Showing love and respect

### Bowing

You will notice that people in Japan bow a lot! This is a way of saying thanks, sorry, hello, goodbye, and welcome, without using words. As a rule of thumb, if someone bows to you, copy them.

As a side note: if you are foreign, it is okay to shake hands with people! Just don't do this instead of bowing, but rather as a compliment, in some occasions. Also, it is probably wise to never initiate a hug. People don't really physically touch each other, unless really close friends. Hugging someone will likely make the person feel uncomfortable. This is especially important to keep in mind for the opposite gender. 

### Gift Giving

Japan is a gift giving culture. Here are some common occasions to give gifts:
* Vising someone's home
* Seeing people after going away on a trip (usually small gifts from the location you visited)
* Moving into an apartment, mansion or house (giving small gifts to the neighbours on either side, and above and below you)
* Attending a wedding (usually money in a special envelope)
* When wanting to express thankyou
* Women/girls give chocolate to male coworkers and friends (not necessarily romantic) on Valentine's Day
* Men/boys give cookies to female coworkers and friends who gave them chocolate on Valentine's Day (again, not necessarily romantic) on White Day

If you remember to give gifts on these occasions, it will go a long way in communicating your cultural understanding and appreciation.

Bonus points: If you bring small gifts from your home country to give to people, it will be greatly appreciated by the recipients!

### Using Both Hands

When receiving anything from anyone, try to remember to use both hands. Same for when giving something to anyone. This can be a business card (which are still important in Japan!), credit card, cash, envelopes, gifts etc.

# Japanese Language

As you may have guessed, in Japan people use Japanese to communicate! Japanese is a wonderful(ly complex) language and we are blessed with an opportunity to learn it!

As we want to reach the Japanese people with the gospel and speak heart-to-heart, we need to communicate fluently in Japanese. This is a high value for our community and we aim to transition YWAM Sendai to function bilingually in Japanese and English as soon as possible. As we are still in the early stages of pioneering YWAM Sendai, and our team is mostly made up of new missionaries to Japan, we are currently functioning in English.

It is expected that all of our non-Japanese team members will spend a good portion of their time during fundraising (before coming) and during the first year or two in Japan studying the language. We will help each person set measurable goals to work towards. Of course, this will look different depending on the person. That being the case, this page outlines what we think is an effective way of learning this language.

Much of this page is based on the fantastic research by redditor [SuikaCider](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuikaCider/) which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bRzVblKVOsQJjTc2PIi1Gbj_LrsJCkMkh0SutXCZdI/edit#).

## Stage One: Build Your Foundation

## A. Kana and Their Sounds (~1-2 weeks)

Before you move into actually understanding, learning, and being proficient in the Japanese language (a life-long process!), you need to establish a solid foundation. There are key aspects of the language that, if you grasp them early on, will help you greatly moving forward. These are **pronunciation and kana**.

**We strongly encourage (if not require) all new staff to understand and learn these two things before coming to Japan.** This will help you immensely once you are in Japan!

### 1. Pronunciation

If your mother tongue is not Japanese, then the sounds you make when you speak will not sound natural when you speak Japanese. This is a cold fact. Even when you think a sound *is* the same as your mother tongue, chances are there is subtle difference. But don't be discouraged! Once you realise this, then you can understand just *what are* the Japanese sounds. You can then begin to learn and practice in order to train your tongue. It is probably optimal to do this, even briefly, before moving on to the kana. This is so you don't develop bad pronunciation habits.

At the very least, please check out these short videos before moving on:
* [Japanese writing systems + pitch accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReTQSh15GII)
* [Japanese consonants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Raq0eo0znLY)
* [Japanese vowels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xcJnHR9MKo)

Understanding these concepts will help you to speak naturally in order to make your Japanese both easy to understand and pleasant to listen to for the native Japanese listener. [Reading this article](http://www.antimoon.com/how/pronuncwhy.htm) may help to see this importance for clearly.

[This article on Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-pronunciation/) will expand on the concepts you were introduced to in the above videos.

Finally, IWTYAL has a [few simple tips](https://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/learn/japanese/japanese-tips/japanese-pronunciation) to quickly level-up your Japanese pronunciation.

You don't have to completely understand pronunciation before moving on. But having a basic understanding of these concepts will help you sound more natural in the long run.

As you proceed to learn kana, keep in mind these concepts in order to solidify your understanding and to train your tongue to sound more natural.

### 2. Kana

Time to attach the sounds you have learnt to Japanese symbols. Hiragana and Katakana are the basic syllabic scripts that make up the Japanese writing system, along with Kanji (Chinese characters).

Every sound in Japanese can be written in kana. Thankfully, hiragana and katakana share the exact same sounds. As a rule of thumb, Hiragana (the curvy characters) are used for Japanese words and grammar particles, while Katakana (the straight characters) are used for imported words. Like foreign names.

Learning the kana is probably the simplest part of learning the language! :) It's all about memorisation. If you focus, you will learn them in a relatively short amount of time. Read out loud as you memorise the characters in order to practice good pronunciation.

Don't spend a lot of time on learning the kana though. Your aim at this point is simply to be loosely familiar with them. They will be reinforced and become second nature as you move forward with learning the language.

A word of caution: **stay away from something known as romaji!!** These are Japanese sounds in written latin alphabet (like English). Your brain will use this as a crutch and your pronunciation and reading will suffer. Pretend it does not exist. Seriously.

#### Build passive recognition

Make a free account at [Read the Kanji](https://www.readthekanji.com/#tour) and work your way through the hiragana and katakana lessons. Cram as much content as you can over a few hours. Remember: don't get hung up on learning them perfectly at this point. You will be seeing these all the time from now on, so get through this as quickly as you can.

This resource is great because it is optimised for your *short term memory*. (Note: don't use Read the Kanji for anything other than kana as there are better resources for the rest of your language learning.)

Tofugu has a [great hiragana guide](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/) for those that prefer to read.

And if you like charts, Tofugu again has you covered:
 [Hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/hiragana-chart/) | [Katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/katakana-chart/)

This part should only take a few hours over a couple of days.

#### Practice active recall

Download [Drops](https://languagedrops.com/language/learn-japanese) on your smartphone and work through their hiragana and katakana modules.

This resource is great because it is optimised for your *long term memory*. (Note: don't use Drops for anything other than kana as there are better resources for the rest of your language learning.)

This part will likely take around a month or so. You can do this while moving forward with your kanji learning.

## B. Build a Vocab and Grammar Base (~6 months)



## And then?

Okay, so maybe you already know hiragana? Or you just learned it in a week or so. (Congrats!) And you're still raising financial support. Which means you have more time to study the language! ;)

Seriously, the more ground work on this you do before you arrive, the better. A solid foundation will really help!

Before getting into the nitty-gritty of Japanese grammar, it is good to learn to read basic kanji, touch up a little more on pronunciation, learn to read katakana, and practice typing it too. If you can work on these things *before* coming to Japan, it will help immensely as you then can focus on grammar without the distraction of learning these basic things from scratch.

Just keep going through the Tofugu page we linked to earlier and you will make good progress.

In terms of kanji learning, they do recommend WaniKani, which they made themselves. I (Gary) use it and think it works extremely well! You can take a trial for free, which is nice. They also tend to do a New Year sale where you can get lifetime access for a really good price.

The Japanese language and culture blog, Tofugu, is rather helpful. Check out the resources on [this page](https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/)!

We also recommend checking out the OMF language resources on [this page](https://omf.org/asia/japan/resources/japanese-language/). They have resources for learning Christian terminology that are particularly useful for missionaries.

May God guide you and open your mind to this exciting and interesting language!

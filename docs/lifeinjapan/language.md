# Japanese Language

As you may have guessed, in Japan people use Japanese to communicate! Japanese is a wonderful(ly complex) language and we are blessed with an opportunity to learn it!

As we want to reach the Japanese people with the gospel and speak heart-to-heart, we need to communicate fluently in Japanese. This is a high value for our community and we aim to transition YWAM Sendai to function bilingually in Japanese and English as soon as possible. As we are still in the early stages of pioneering YWAM Sendai, and our team is mostly made up of new missionaries to Japan, we are currently functioning in English.

It is expected that all of our non-Japanese team members will spend a good portion of their time during fundraising (before coming) and during the first year or two in Japan studying the language. We will help each person set measurable goals to work towards. Of course, this will look different depending on the person. That being the case, this page outlines what we think is an effective way of learning this language.

Much of this page is based on the fantastic research by redditor [SuikaCider](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuikaCider/) which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bRzVblKVOsQJjTc2PIi1Gbj_LrsJCkMkh0SutXCZdI/edit#).

## Stage One: Build Your Foundation

## A. Kana and Their Sounds (~1-2 weeks)

Before you move into actually understanding, learning, and being proficient in the Japanese language (a life-long process!), you need to establish a solid foundation. There are key aspects of the language that, if you grasp them early on, will help you greatly moving forward. These are **pronunciation and kana**.

**We strongly encourage (if not require) all new staff to understand and learn these two things before coming to Japan.** This will help you immensely once you are in Japan!

### 1. Pronunciation

If your mother tongue is not Japanese, then the sounds you make when you speak will not sound natural when you speak Japanese. This is a cold fact. Even when you think a sound *is* the same as your mother tongue, chances are there is subtle difference. But don't be discouraged! Once you realise this, then you can understand just *what are* the Japanese sounds. You can then begin to learn and practice in order to train your tongue. It is probably optimal to do this, even briefly, before moving on to the kana. This is so you don't develop bad pronunciation habits.

At the very least, please check out these short videos before moving on:

* [Japanese writing systems + pitch accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReTQSh15GII)
* [Japanese consonants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Raq0eo0znLY)
* [Japanese vowels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xcJnHR9MKo)

Understanding these concepts will help you to speak naturally in order to make your Japanese both easy to understand and pleasant to listen to for the native Japanese listener. [Reading this article](http://www.antimoon.com/how/pronuncwhy.htm) may help to see this importance for clearly.

[This article on Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-pronunciation/) will expand on the concepts you were introduced to in the above videos.

Finally, IWTYAL has a [few simple tips](https://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/learn/japanese/japanese-tips/japanese-pronunciation) to quickly level-up your Japanese pronunciation.

You don't have to completely understand pronunciation before moving on. But having a basic understanding of these concepts will help you sound more natural in the long run.

As you proceed to learn kana, keep in mind these concepts in order to solidify your understanding and to train your tongue to sound more natural.

### 2. Kana

Time to attach the sounds you have learnt to Japanese symbols. Hiragana and Katakana are the basic syllabic scripts that make up the Japanese writing system, along with Kanji (Chinese characters).

Every sound in Japanese can be written in kana. Thankfully, hiragana and katakana share the exact same sounds. As a rule of thumb, Hiragana (the curvy characters) are used for Japanese words and grammar particles, while Katakana (the straight characters) are used for imported words. Like foreign names.

Learning the kana is probably the simplest part of learning the language! :) It's all about memorisation. If you focus, you will learn them in a relatively short amount of time. Read out loud as you memorise the characters in order to practice good pronunciation.

Don't spend a lot of time on learning the kana though. Your aim at this point is simply to be loosely familiar with them. They will be reinforced and become second nature as you move forward with learning the language.

A word of caution: **stay away from something known as romaji!!** These are Japanese sounds in written latin alphabet (like English). Your brain will use this as a crutch and your pronunciation and reading will suffer. Pretend it does not exist. Seriously.

#### Build passive recognition

Make a free account at [Read the Kanji](https://www.readthekanji.com/#tour) and work your way through the hiragana and katakana lessons. Cram as much content as you can over a few hours. Remember: don't get hung up on learning them perfectly at this point. You will be seeing these all the time from now on, so get through this as quickly as you can.

This resource is great because it is optimised for your *short term memory*. (Note: don't use Read the Kanji for anything other than kana as there are better resources for the rest of your language learning.)

Tofugu has a [great hiragana guide](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/) for those that prefer to read.

And if you like charts, Tofugu again has you covered:
 [Hiragana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/hiragana-chart/) | [Katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/katakana-chart/)

This part should only take a few hours over a couple of days.

#### Practice active recall

Download [Drops](https://languagedrops.com/language/learn-japanese) on your smartphone and work through their hiragana and katakana modules.

This resource is great because it is optimised for your *long term memory*. (Note: don't use Drops for anything other than kana as there are better resources for the rest of your language learning.)

This part will likely take around a month or so. You can do this while moving forward with your kanji, vocab, and grammar learning.

## B. Build a Vocab and Grammar Base (~6 months)

In order to prepare you for immersion in the language while living in Japan, you will need a strong base of vocabulary and grammar. So now you know the sounds and kana, it is time to start learning both of these.

If you are an incoming new staff, it would be good to begin this process as soon as you can while fundraising.

### 1. Kanji

First, it is recommended you start learning kanji as it will make learning vocab and grammar easier in the long run. As there are thousands of them, and they can look extremely complex, learning kanji can seem very daunting. But as long as you have a good system in place, you will be surprised by how many you can understand in a short amount of time!

At this point, the most important thing to keep in mind is that you want to recognise as many kanji as you can in a relatively short amount of time. It will take years of using kanji in order to actually learn them along with all their readings. So try not to get bogged down by memorising all of their sounds or stroke orders. Right now, you need to decide which system you will use. Then you need to stick with it. You will be investing a few hundred hours into this, so make sure you understand your options.

Here are a few good options for you to consider:

* **[WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/)** is a fantastic Spaced Repetition System (SRS) that uses mnemonics in order to teach you around 2,000 kanji and around 6,000 vocab using those kanji. It breaks down each kanji into radicals, making the learning process much easier. This tool is highly recommended as it walks you through the whole process in a fun way--levelling up as you progress. WaniKani requires a monthly subscription which costs $9 per month, but there is an annual New Year sale which costs $299 for lifetime access (previous months paid for during that year are subtracted from the amount too).

* **[Read the Kanji](https://www.readthekanji.com/#tour)** breaks the kanji up by JLPT level which is convenient. If you learnt kana using this, then you already know how it works. The issue is that it doesn't break down the kanji into radicals, meaning you will have to do that yourself, and you have to know which desks to choose. But it does attempt to make the process interesting by levelling up as you progress. Read the Kanji requires a monthly subscription which costs $5 per month.

* You can also add your own desks to **Anki**--a free SRS application. A good deck to add to the software is **[All In One Kanji Desk (RTK Order)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/215365929)**. This will teach you 3,000 kanji. If you learn 5 new cards each day, it will take you 2 years to complete the deck. It would also be good to go through this **[Kanji Radical](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1044119361)** deck too to make the learning process much easier. This system is free, but will require much more time, work, and self discipline in order for it to be effective.

Once you have chosen your system, stick with it! **Do your reviews every day.** Don't spend time writing the kanji at this point (this will slow you down considerably, and handwriting is seldom done today). Focus on being able to **recognise the meaning** of the kanji, memorise the **most common reading**, and **learn common vocab** that use the kanji.

Start the process of learning grammar once you have learnt around 300 kanji.

### 2. Grammar

#### Focus on the grammar, hope for native content

Now that you have some kanji under your belt, it is time to start learning grammar. It is said that, for Westerners, Japanese is one of the hardest languages to learn. This is especially the case because Japanese [sentence structure](https://8020japanese.com/japanese-sentence-structure/) is very different. But once you understand the basic concepts, its actually [very simple](https://smilenihongo.com/basic-japanese-sentence-structure).

As you begin to learn grammar, remember this: it's okay to feel frustrated. You may at some points feel dumb. "Why aren't I getting it!?" You may also realise you keep forgetting what you have learnt. But this is okay. It is not just you. Japanese is hard! But you will get there.

At the point, the goal is to have a basic understanding of Japanese grammar. This, along with going through your kanji and vocab reviews, will enable you to stumble through native Japanese content. That is when a lot of things will actually *click*, and learning Japanese transitions from a chore to actually having fun. You will also feel more confident when practicing your speaking and listening with Japanese people.

Here, we will outline an effective action plan, which will take around 6 months:

1. Purchase Japanese grammar textbooks. We recommend Genki I and Genki II. Get both the textbooks and the workbooks.

2. Work through [one section](http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/about_en/about06_en) per day. (e.g. Numbers on one day, then Time the next, then Telephone numbers etc.) There are 137 sections in total. (ignore the reading and writing section of the book.)

3. Complete the corresponding sections in the workbook with a one week delay. (e.g. complete the Numbers section 7 days after doing it in the textbook.) This will help you retain the grammar points in your memory.

4. Take the weekends off. Use this time to consume Japanese media. Make note of content you'd like to use in the future for study.

#### Focus on native content, refine grammar

You have now finished Genki II! You may be thinking "but I am not sure I remember everything!" Don't worry. This is normal. The task now is to review what you have learnt, while learning more advanced grammar.




## Christian-Specific Japanese

We recommend checking out the OMF language resources on [this page](https://omf.org/asia/japan/resources/japanese-language/). They have resources for learning Christian terminology that are particularly useful for missionaries.


May God guide you and open your mind to this exciting and interesting language!

# Disaster Preparation

Japan is a country that experiences natural phenomena on a regular basis, such as earthquakes and typhoons. Sometimes, these can cause damage which can lead to emergency situations. This page details some ways we can be prepared.

## Furniture

Make sure that tall furniture such as bookshelves are secured to the wall or ceiling. You can get extendable devices to place on the top of them that push them up against the ceiling.

Also make sure you don't have breakable items, such as photo frames, mugs, or clocks on a high place (especially not near where you sleep!).

## Food and Drink

Stock the following items per person:

* Drinking water: 3 days worth (approx. 1L per day)
* Emergency food: rice (such as alpha rice), biscuits, chocolate bars, dried bread etc for 3 days
* Toilet paper, tissue paper, matches, candles, portable gas stove etc.

If possible, for a large-scale disaster, it may be worth stocking enough for 1 week.

Also, you will need water other than for drinking. If possible, after an earthquake, fill your bathtub with water which you can then use.

## Emergency Bag

Example emergency bag to put together:

* Drinking water and food (cup noodles, canned food, biscuits, chocolate, etc.)
* Valuables (bankbook, seal, cash, copies of residence card, health insurance card, passport, etc.)
* First-aid equipment (bands, bandages, antiseptic solutions, regular medicine, etc.)
* Helmet, disaster prevention hood, masks, work gloves
* Flashlight, mobile radio, spare battery, mobile phone charger
* Clothing, underwear, blankets, towels
* Toiletries, disposable body warmers (カイロ), wet tissues, mobile toilets
* For families with infants: prepare formula milk, disposable nappies, baby bottles, etc.

## Evacuation Location

Be aware of the location and route of your designated evacuation point.

For example, the evacuation points around Ayashi station are Hirose Middle School and Ayashi Primary School.

## Warning App

You can install a disaster warning app on your phone such as Yurekuru Call, which is in English.

# Welcome to the YWAM Sendai Wiki

**Hello there!** This is the place to be in order to learn all about YWAM Sendai!

This wiki acts as a handbook to our community.

For more information on who we are, please visit our website: [ywamsendai.org](https://www.ywamsendai.org)

## Who or What is YWAM Sendai?

The Japanese are one of the [largest unreached people groups](/ywam/whyjapan) in the world. In North-East Japan, or *Tohoku*, there are many areas with no churches, missionaries, or Christians.

YWAM Sendai is a local expression of the global YWAM movement. We are pioneering a missional community in Sendai, the hub of Tohoku, in order to communicate God's love to the Japanese in a way they will understand. For more information, visit the [YWAM](ywam/ywam.md) section.

## Join Us!

We are praying for more workers! For more worshippers! Please join us! For more information on how to join us as staff, visit the [Join Us](ywam/join.md) section.

## Life in Japan

Japan is a wonderful place to live, with a rich culture, long history, and beautiful language. New people to Japan may feel overwhelmed, especially not knowing the language. But we are here to help! Please visit the [Life in Japan](languageandculture/culture.md) section to find out some helpful tips and advice for life in Japan.

# Welcome to the YWAM Sendai Wiki

**Hello there!** This is the place to be in order to learn all about YWAM Sendai!

This wiki acts as a handbook to our community.

For more information on who we are, please visit our website: [ywamsendai.org](https://www.ywamsendai.org)

## What is Christianity like in North-East Japan?

The Japanese are one of the largest unreached people groups in the world. In North-East Japan, or Tohoku, there are many areas with no churches, missionaries, or Christians. To find out more, [see here](/ywam/whyjapan).

## Enter: YWAM Sendai!

YWAM Sendai is a local expression of the global YWAM movement. We are pioneering a missional community in Sendai, the hub of North-East Japan, in order to communicate God's love to the Japanese in a way they will understand.

There are two ways to be involved in our community, and both ways are essential in order for us to achieve our vision to reach the Japanese people! You can either be a **Staff** or a **Supporter**.

## Staff and Supporters: We are in this together!

### Staff

Feel a call to advance God's Kingdom in North-East Japan? We are praying for more people to come and join our team in Sendai, Japan! The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.

If you are interested in joining us in Sendai, please explore this wiki and get in touch with us on Telegram or Matrix (details below).

### Supporters

The Japanese people cannot be reached by a few individuals alone. In YWAM Sendai, none of our team members receive a wage, but instead rely on God's provision - primarily through people around the world who believe in what we are doing.

Traditionally, there has been a disconnect between Supporters (those praying for and financial supporting overseas missionaries) and Missionaries (those that are on the ground making things happen to advance the Kingdom). Actually, Supporters and Missionaries are working together equally!

Of course, to be a Supporter does not just mean giving financially. We also need your prayers and wisdom too! So whether you'd like to financially support one of our staff or YWAM Sendai in general, or whether you want to commit to pray for us and the Japanese people, or even if you'd just like to find out more about what we are doing and to say hello, you're very welcome to be a part of our community in some way! We need you!

### Join Us!

So whether you want to join us in Sendai, or you want to support us from afar, please join us!

You can join our community via [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/O4PX5BsUYLG64lCazgT8Ng) or [Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/group/+ywamsendai:matrix.org)! Please join and introduce yourself! :)

Our hope is that this wiki, and our online rooms on Telegram and Matrix, will help us in establishing a community that will spread the Gospel to the Japanese! From all over the world!

#Team Commitments & Expectations

For those that commit to join us as full-time team members, we have the following commitments and expectations.

##Love God

Your number one commitment in life is to love God. To place Him before everything else you do. He is the reason we are all here in Japan! We desire that each team member really invest in their relationship with God. We hope the peaceful environment where we are based in Sendai will help facilitate this!

###Prayer

Everything we do needs to be birthed out of prayer. Each of our team members hear from God. We need to commit to spending time with God and turning our ears towards Him. Prayer looks different for each person. But setting time aside daily for Him is essential. Our personal time with God is priority, though we also value praying together as a community also.

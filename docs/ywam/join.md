# Join the Team!

If you feel you may be called to Japan, and if you are willing to drop everything and follow the leading of Holy Spirit to love the Japanese, then we would love to have you join our team!

As a team member at YWAM Sendai, you will become an integral part of a pioneering missional community where your giftings and personality will shape our culture and influence how we reach the Japanese. We will pray together, worship together, work together, dream together, and have fun together. All of our team members are encouraged to invest in spiritual disciplines so as to deepen our awareness of Jesusâ€™ wonderful presence in our lives. It is out of a place of rest and satisfaction in God that we can pour out love to those that are loved by Him.

You should come ready to pursue God in prayer and worship and be committed to developing a naturally supernatural lifestyle. You should also be flexible as this is a pioneering YWAM community.

## The Process

* Connect with us either via [email](mailto:people@ywamsendai.org) or on [Riot](tools.md), introduce yourself, share what God has placed on your heart, and ask us questions.

* You will have had to have completed a YWAM DTS somewhere in the world.

* We will send you an application form. This part will also include us sending character reference forms to three people that know you.

* Once we have everything, we will pray and discuss as a team about whether we feel this is where God wants you to be. And let you know!

* You will then start [fundraising](fundraising.md)! You will find info on how much to raise on the [finances page](finances.md).

* Explore this wiki to find information on Japan culture, YWAM culture, budgeting, language learning tips etc.

* Once you have reached at least the Minimum Support Level of financial support, we will start the visa process!

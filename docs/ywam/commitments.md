# Being a YWAM Sendai Staff

For those that commit to join us as full-time staff, we have the following commitments and expectations.

## Be a YWAMer!

To join our team, you would have had to have completed a DTS. The hope is that some of the YWAM 'DNA' rubbed off on to you there. Our expectation is that you will not only know what YWAM is about, but you will live it. You will pursue God and people as set out in our [YWAM Purpose, Beliefs & Values](values.md).

We ask all of our team members, new and old, to refresh themselves regularly on what it means to be a YWAMer.

## Be a Jesus-Follower!

Our expectation is that each of our staff will have an active, ongoing spiritual life which inspires and challenges other members of the team and the local Japanese people. This includes investing in your relationship with God by keeping spiritual disciplines such as regular prayer, Bible study, and worship. ALso to wholeheartedly participate in our corporate times of worship, prayer, and intercession.

Of course, things aren't always rosy, so we encourage everyone to be real and honest about how they are doing spiritually also, reaching out for prayer.

## Be Part of the Team!

ALl of us here at YWAM Sendai are called by God not just as individuals, but to be part of a team. Each of us are to contribute to building and being a part of a strong YWAM Sendai team. This means pursuing to love and champion each other wholeheartedly, trusting each other. Of course, we are humans. Sometimes humans disagree! A strong team doesn't back away from such disagreements, but engages in healthy, productive conflict. This can only happen when we trust each other.

Being part of a team also means being committed to serving wholeheartedly the vision and goals of YWAM Sendai (prioritizing team schedule, being quick to help out etc.). We choose to hold each other accountable and call each other higher when necessary (pointing to these expectations when necessary!).

## Be Part of the Body!

We are the Body of Christ. This is true. We want YWAM Sendai to live like the Bible, without hinderance. We will worship, pray, eat, minister, work laugh, interceed, love, sing, cry, study.. together! After all, we are the Church, right?

That being said, it is our expectation that all of our team members will pursue relationship with local Japanese believers and get stuck into the places where they are worshipping and being church. It doesn't matter about style, right? If they enjoy singing old hymns, what is that to us? Love and serve. And let us model how we think the Church should be, and maybe we will be a refreshment and encouragement to God's people here in Sendai.

## Be Japanese (Well.. At Least Be Open to Learn)!

Joining our team means God brought you to Japan in order to love the Japanese people. In order to do this, you will want to speak with people's hearts. And listen to people's hearts. If you don't know the language or the culture, your ability to love (to communicate) is handicapped! :( Our expectation is that you will develop a passion to learn this culture and language, and to keep learning even when it gets tough. Its worth it! You can do it! 

One good way to learn in to pursue opportunities to be immersed in Japanese-only settings (e.g. church). This can be difficult, especially at the beginning--but it is worth it! Also, food is a huge part of Japanese culture. We encourage our staff to try everything at least twice (even if you're not too sure!) and cook Japanese food at home and as a community. This attitude will speak loudly!

To learn this language requires discipline and good strategy. We encourage each staff to set achievable goals in language study and to stick to a study schedule. We are in this together, so we ask everyone to keep each other accountable. As we want to become a bilingual YWAM base, we also challenge each other to speak in Japanese together. A great way to practice (and stay humble!).

There are many opportunities to practice and learn the language in Sendai. Please seek them out! Read [this page](language.md) for some pointers in (what we think) is the right direction to get you started.

## Be Wise with Time!

Our expectation is that each of our staff manage their time well, having an attitude of working as hard as those supporting us to be here, giving around 35 hours per week to “work” (not including meals, personal time with God, personal skill development/hobbies, fellowship with each other etc.). What would this look like?

Category | Hours per Week | Description
--------- | --------- | ---------
**YWAM Sendai Functioning** | 7 hours (20% of time) | All scheduled meetings, weekly worship and training, weekly intercession, role-related work, etc.
**Ministry** | 28 hours (80% of time) | Event prep, kokubuncho, DTS/school prep, meeting Japanese people, prayer walking, evangelism, etc.
**Language Study** | Up to 14 hours (50% of ministry) | For all new non-Japanese speaking staff: up to 50% of ministry time studying the Japanese language for up to 2 years, working towards achieving JLPT N2 – leaving at least 14 hours for ministry

## Be Wise with Money!

Money. お金 (O-kane). You can think of it as a necessary evil. Or you can think of it as a blessing. Lets treat it as a blessing from God and use it generously and wisely. Not everyone knows how to use money. Its a skill! Our expectation is that you will learn how to budget and record your finances well and with integrity. This can actually help you be more generous!

As we want to be a blessing in Japan (and generally just be good people), we expect that each staff member makes sure to make all required monthly payments: rent, utilities, phone bills, health insurance, etc. YWAM Sendai is not responsible for your finances, so missed payments could mean penalty fees, jail time, or even deportation.

While trusting in God alone for our needs, we believe it is good stewardship of his resources to prepare for various unforeseen expenses. These include personal emergency, disaster relief, outreach, YWAM conferences (usually one each year), medical expenses, flights home, childcare & education, clothing, new electronic devices, taxes and pension (phew!). 

We ask all of our team members to make a monthly contribution to our community. Don't worry, its not filling the base leader's pockets. YWAM Sendai does not have its own income and relies on these monthly donations in order to function as a team. Please read [this page to find out what its used for](finances.md). 

There is always need for ongoing fundraising. This is a combination of the rise of living expenses here, as well as support being dropped back home. It is vital to communicate regularly to supporters and churches, both for prayer support and for financial support. It is also important to make trips to visit supporters and churches around once every two years for a month or two in order to renew connections with supporters, churches, family and friends.

## Be a Good Communicator!

Don't you just love it when a team communicates really well together? It's great! Our expectation is that you will fit right in to the community and actively participate in discussions, meetings etc. Our community communicates both in person, and online! So you can be extrovert or introvert and still participate. Yay! But seriously, lets aim to over-communicate, rather than under-communicate. Especially as our community grows (and pioneers new communities!). 

We have a document to show you how to have a [Riot](tools.md) with us! ;)



###Prayer

Everything we do needs to be birthed out of prayer. Each of our team members hear from God. We need to commit to spending time with God and turning our ears towards Him. Prayer looks different for each person. But setting time aside daily for Him is essential. Our personal time with God is priority, though we also value praying together as a community also.

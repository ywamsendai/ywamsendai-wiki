# Being a Team Member

For those that commit to join us as full-time team members, we have the following commitments and expectations.

## Be a YWAMer!

To join our team, you would have had to have completed a DTS. The hope is that some of the YWAM 'DNA' rubbed off on to you there. Our expectation is that you will not only know what YWAM is about, but you will live it. You will pursue God and people as set out in our [YWAM Purpose, Beliefs & Values](values.md).

We ask all of our team members, new and old, to refresh themselves regularly on what it means to be a YWAMer.

## Be Japanese (Understanding)!

Joining our team means God brought you to Japan in order to love the Japanese people. In order to do this, you will want to speak with people's hearts. And listen to people's hearts. If you don't know the language, your ability to love (to communicate) is handicapped! :(

Our expectation is that you will develop a passion to learn this language, and to keep learning even when it gets tough. Its worth it! You can do it! Read [this page](language.md) for some pointers in (what we think) is the right direction.

## Be Wise with Money!

Money. お金 (O-kane). You can think of it as a necessary evil. Or you can think of it as a blessing. Lets treat it as a blessing from God and use it generously and wisely. Not everyone know how to use money. Its a skill! Our expectation is that you will learn how to budget and record your finances well and with integrity. This can actually help you be more generous!

Speaking of generosity, we ask all of our team members to make a monthly contribution to our community. Don't worry, its not filling the base leader's pockets (who is that anyway?). We need money to function as a team. Seriously. Pray about the amount, and be generous! :) Please read [this page to find out what its used for](finances.md). 

## Be a Good Communicator!

Don't you just love it when a team communicates really well together? It's great! Our expectation is that you will fit right in to the community and actively participate in discussions, meetings etc. Our community communicates both in person, and online! So you can be extrovert or introvert and still participate. Yay! But seriously, lets aim to over-communicate, rather than under-communicate. Especially as our community grows (and pioneers new communities!). 

We have a document to show you how to have a [Riot](tools.md) with us! ;)

## Be Part of the Body!

We are the Body of Christ. This is true. We want YWAM Sendai to live like the Bible, without hinderance. We will worship, pray, eat, minister, work laugh, interceed, love, sing, cry, study.. together! After all, we are the Church, right?

That being said, it is our expectation that all of our team members will pursue relationship with local Japanese believers and get stuck into the places where they are worshipping and being church. It doesn't matter about style, right? If they enjoy singing old hymns, what is that to us? Love and serve. And let us model how we think the Church should be, and maybe we will be a refreshment and encouragement to God's people here in Sendai.

###Prayer

Everything we do needs to be birthed out of prayer. Each of our team members hear from God. We need to commit to spending time with God and turning our ears towards Him. Prayer looks different for each person. But setting time aside daily for Him is essential. Our personal time with God is priority, though we also value praying together as a community also.

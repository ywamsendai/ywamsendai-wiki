# Time Away

This page details our policy on time away, holidays, and furlough.

## Sabbath

All staff are encouraged to take one full day off per week. This is usually Saturday or Sunday. If staff have ministry related things planned on both of those days, they are encouraged to discuss a different time off on a weekday with the YWAM Sendai leaders.

## Holidays

As much as possible, we aim to take all Japanese national holidays off. This may not always be the case, especially during the running of schools. In this case, time off will be given after the school has graduated.

On top of these holidays, all staff are encouraged to take another 10 weekdays off each year. Time off should be discussed with the YWAM Sendai leaders.

## Furlough / Home Assignment

It is important to communicate well with family, friends and supporters. As part of investing in these relationships, as well as for fundraising, it is important to travel back to the sending country periodically. This is different than a holiday as it requires intentionality and sharing about Japan with churches and individuals.

We recommend that all staff consider travelling to their sending country for a maximum of two months every two years.

Please discuss this with the YWAM Sendai leaders ahead of time.

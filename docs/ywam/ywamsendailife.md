# Life at YWAM Sendai

Here is a glimpse of what life is like as a Sendai YWAMer on a weekly basis.

For more information on staffing at YWAM Sendai, check out the [commitments and expectations](commitments.md).

## Core Schedule

These are the regular times where we expect all of our staff to attend.

### Worship & Intercession

Every **Tuesday morning from 09:30 to 11:30** we meet together for worship and intercession when we focus on God together and pray for what is on God's heart. We also bring a bento to eat lunch together.

### Staff Meeting

After a lunch break, every **Tuesday afternoon from 12:30 to 13:30** we have our staff meeting where we share testimonies, hear reports from the various ministry groups and departments, and note upcoming schedule-related things. We also pray for incoming and outgoing staff during this time.

### Community Fun Night

Every **Friday evening** we prepare and eat a meal together in one of our homes, followed by playing games or watching a movie together. This is a relaxing and fun time where we just enjoy each other. We also celebrate birthdays and other occasions together too.

## Other Things Happening

We encourage all of our staff to prayerfully commit to things throughout the week, whether these are existing ministries, new ministries, or serving with local churches or NGOs. Here are some things we currently do.

### Prayer Walks

We prayer walk around various places such as neighbourhoods, train stations, shopping districts, temples, shrines, and universities in order to gain God's heart for the people of Sendai. We are also seeking opportunity establish new ministries and for a building to use for meetings and ministry.

### Homeless Ministry

We partner with a church that ministers to the homeless in central Sendai. This is every **every Friday morning**.

### Worship in the Entertainment District

On **Thursday evenings** we worship in a park in *kokubuncho*, Sendai's entertainment and red-light district.

### Japanese Practice

We also sometimes meet together in order to intentionally practice Japanese. It's lots of fun, and good practice! This being the case, we do encourage everyone to practice their Japanese whenever possible!

# Life at YWAM Sendai

## Worship & Devotions

Every **Tuesday morning from 10:00 to 12:00** we meet together for worship and a devotional to start the week. We also bring a bento to eat lunch together.

## Staff Meeting

Every **Wednesday morning from 10:00 to 11:00** we have our staff meeting where we share testimonies, hear reports from the various ministry groups and departments, and note upcoming schedule-related things. We also pray for incoming and outgoing staff during this time.

## Prayer Walk

Every **Wednesday afternoon** we prayer walk around various places such as neighbourhoods, train stations, shopping districts, temples, shrines, and universities in order to gain God's heart for the people of Sendai. We are also seeking opportunity establish new ministries.

## Intercession

Every **Thursday morning from 11:00 to 12:00** we meet to intercede for what is on God's heart.

## Japanese Lunch

Every **Thursday lunch-time**, after intercession, we eat our bentos together while intentionally practicing Japanese. It's lots of fun, and good practice!

## Worship in the Entertainment District

Every **Thursday evening** we worship in a park in *kokubuncho*, Sendai's entertainment and red-light district.

## Community Fun Night

Every **Friday evening** we prepare and eat a meal together in one of our homes, followed by playing games or watching a movie together. This is a relaxing and fun time where we just enjoy each other. We also celebrate birthdays and other occasions together too.

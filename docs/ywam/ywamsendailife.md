# Life at YWAM Sendai

Here is a glimpse of what life is like as a Sendai YWAMer.

## Meeting Together

We have the following times set in the weekly schedule in order to build a sense of community within our team.

### Community Meal

Every Monday from 17:30 to 18:30, we come together for a meal. Usually everyone brings their own food, but on special occasions we will eat a proper meal together. We usually celebrate birthdays and other occasions at this time too.

### Small Groups

Once a week, we also meet in small groups. These are gender-based groups where we get together to pray, read the Bible and have fun getting to know each other! As of now, the girl's group meets on a Monday evening, and the guys meet on a Wednesday evening.

### Worship & Intercession

Every Wednesday from 15:00 to 17:00, we meet as a community for worship and intercession. We usually spend around an hour for each.

### Team Meeting

Every Friday from 15:30 to 17:00, we have our team meeting where we share any prayer needs, share any testimonies, note upcoming schedule-related things, and discuss a YWAM Foundational Value.

## Time Management

As we are a new YWAM location, we do not currently have a lot going on in the set schedule. Because of this, each staff member must manage their own time and take initiative. As a guideline, we ask that each person schedule around 35 hours of work-time per week. For those that are not fluent in the Japanese language, it is expected that up to half of this time be dedicated to learning the language, depending on fluency level. The YWAM Sendai leaders will assist each person in scheduling their time.

## Time Away

This page details our policy on time away, holidays, and furlough.

### Sabbath

All staff are encouraged to take one full day off per week. This is usually Saturday or Sunday. If staff have ministry related things planned on both of those days, they are encouraged to discuss a different time off on a weekday with the YWAM Sendai leaders.

### Holidays

As much as possible, we aim to take all Japanese national holidays off. This may not always be the case, especially during the running of schools. In this case, time off will be given after the school has graduated.

On top of these holidays, all staff are encouraged to take another 10 weekdays off each year. Time off should be discussed with the YWAM Sendai leaders.

### Furlough / Home Assignment

It is important to communicate well with family, friends and supporters. As part of investing in these relationships, as well as for fundraising, it is important to travel back to the sending country periodically. This is different than a holiday as it requires intentionality and sharing about Japan with churches and individuals.

We recommend that all staff consider travelling to their sending country for a maximum of two months every two years.

Please discuss this with the YWAM Sendai leaders ahead of time.

# Religious Worker Visa

Part of the [process to join as YWAM Sendai staff](join.md) as a non-Japanese national is to receive a visa from Japanese Immigration. YWAM Japan assists all YWAMers accepted as staff in Japan with applying for the Religious Worker visa. This page details this process. **Please follow this process carefully.**

Let us know if you have any questions about anything on this page, and please stay in touch with us throughout the process so we know how you are doing. We are looking forward to your arrival and being part of your journey in discovering your call to Japan!

**Note: the visa process has been affected due to COVID-19. We will discuss these changes with you as you begin this process.**

## The Process

* Inform us that you have reached at least the [Minimum Support Level](finances.md) of financial support and would like to begin this process.

* We will send you a **Visa Application** form.

* You send us all required documents via **both** email and physical mail (detailed below).

* We then apply for a Certificate of Eligibility (CoE) from Japanese Immigration once we receive your documents (can take 6 to 12 weeks).

* We will send you the CoE once we receive it.

* You then go to your local Japanese Embassy or Consulate and submit a visa application form, the CoE, and your passport in order to apply for your visa.

* Usually within a few days, you can return to the Embassy or Consulate to pick up your passport with your visa! This likely must be done in person, but sometimes they give you the option to receive it via mail. You can check this with them.

* You can now book your flight to Japan! (**Note: please don’t purchase your airline ticket until your visa is issued in case of unexpected delays**).

* You must enter Japan within 3 months of receiving your visa.

## Required Documents and Letters

Please find below a list of what we need from you in order to begin the process of applying for your CoE.

* Copy of your passport - COVER PAGE ONLY (the copy must be clear and all information legible)

* A 4cm x 3cm photograph (Photos should be clear, with a plain background and recently taken. Applicant in photo should be facing forward, without sunglasses, hats, etc.)

* Two original, signed letters on church stationary, NOT COPIES, from your sending church.
(We will send you the template documents and you can ask your church to copy and paste the text of the correct wording into each letter and fill in the necessary information, such as your name, your church name, and your pastor’s signature, into the relevant blank spaces. We standardised the wording to simplify the process because each of the letters must contain certain information and specific wording.)

* Letter of Dispatch

* Letter of Release

Please send all printed documents to the given mailing address, and email scanned copies to people@ywamsendai.org

**Notes:**

* If any of these documents are in another language other than English or Japanese, please provide a translation of everything written on the document into English or Japanese for us.

* The second Church letter states that your church provides financial support of you during your time in Japan. This assurance is very important to the Immigration Department, who would be concerned that immigrants become stranded or destitute while in Japan. It isn’t that your church must technically promise to support your every need, because your missionary support will most likely come from many supporters. But in the spirit of the law, if one organisation will officially vouch for you, the Japanese Government will be more comfortable to grant the visa. YWAM Japan must also vouch for you in this way. This letter is **not** a legally binding document requiring your church to meet your every need. Each missionary to Japan needs a church to stand with him officially, but in reality we understand that God is our source. We will provide a letter you can give to your pastor to explain this. If your church is extremely uncomfortable with this, please let us know and we can try an alternate wording.

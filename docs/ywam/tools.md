#Tools

This page acts as a description of the tools used within YWAM Sendai that we feel are important to realize the basic operation of an efficient community.

We always aim to streamline processes and transfer between tools if it increases transparency, security, usability or means being able to change a tool for an open-source alternative.

##Chat

The backbone of YWAM Sendai communication is the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) protocol--an open network for secure, decentralized communication.

We have installed bridges from all of our rooms on Matrix to Discord. Our main public room is also bridged to Telegram.

To connect with our community, you can use one of the following apps:

* [Discord](https://discord.gg/djmCF4DBaV)
* [Element](https://app.element.io/#/group/+ywamsendai:matrix.org) (Native Matrix app)
* [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/O4PX5BsUYLG64lCazgT8Ng) (Main public room only)

If you are joining us as staff, please use either Discord or Element.

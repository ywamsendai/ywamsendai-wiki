#Tools

This page acts as a description of the tools used within YWAM Sendai that we feel are important to realize the basic operation of an efficient community.

We always aim to streamline processes and transfer between tools if it increases transparency, security, usability or means being able to change a tool for an open-source alternative.

##Chat

The YWAM Sendai community mainly communicates through Riot.im (an open-source work chat application).

# YWAM's Legacy Words and Covenants

## YWAM Legacy Words

YWAM’s identity and mission is further clarified by what we know as the “*Four Legacy Words*” given by God to Loren Cunningham through the years. These are the major words of the Lord, which over our history have guided us and shaped our inheritance as a mission.

1. [The Covenantal Vision of the Waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFegcXU5Cfk), which Loren received in June of 1956 in the Bahamas shortly before his 21st birthday.

2. [The Call to Disciple Nations through the Seven Spheres of Society](https://www.ywam.org/custom-content/uploads/2014/09/God-Revealed-through-the-Spheres-of-Society.pdf)

3. [The Christian Magna Carta](https://ywam.org/about-us/the-christian-magna-carta/)

4. [The Commitment to End Bible Poverty Now](https://www.ywam.org/blog/2015/10/06/pray-to-end-bible-poverty/)

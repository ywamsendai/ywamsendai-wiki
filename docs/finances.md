#Member Finances

This page details fundraising goals we feel are good for our team members to aim for, details the YWAM Sendai Community Fee, and gives some tips on budgeting.

##Financial Support Levels

In YWAM, nobody gets paid by YWAM! In fact, YWAMers pay to work! (See below). In all honesty, we have a value for total reliance on God and to have faith that God is who He says He is - Provider. We believe that God will fully provide for those He calls to the mission field.

As a mission field, Japan is a particularly expensive place for a missionary. We have seen people come in faith, with hardly any pledged financial support. Actually, God has led YWAMers in this way and provided for them fully! And we believe God is still capable of doing that in Japan! But we have seen people like this struggle, and for whatever reason, their finances do not come in. This is disheartening. But it is especially difficult when people start to get into debt because it is so expensive to live here! We don't know the reasons why God allows for this, but we don't believe its ever God's plan for people to struggle continuously and to get into debt.

We have prayerfully decided to set financial support levels that our team members are to aim for when fundraising to join our team. We believe reaching these levels of support will allow our community to focus on Jesus and the Japanese people, rather than being distracted by a lack of finances.

To keep things simple, we have two levels: **Minimum Support Level (MSL)** and **Recommended Support Level (RSL)**.

The MSL is what we feel to be the very minimum amount of monthly income to have in order to live in Japan. We will not start a new team member's visa process until they have reached this level.

The RSL is what we feel to be a moderately comfortable amount of monthly income to have. This allows for more generosity as well as to be able to save for an emergency fund.

We have set different amounts depending on one's circumstances. Here are the current support levels:

Category | MSL | RSL
--------- | --------- | ---------
**Individual** | ¥110,000 | ¥150,000
**Couple** | ¥190,000 | ¥250,000
**Family (1 child)** | ¥260,000 | ¥350,000

## Community Fee

As each team member is financially supported in order to live in Japan, most team member's needs are met. Though this is the case, YWAM Sendai has expenses as a community that are not initially met as YWAM Sendai does not have regular set income. In order to meet these needs, we ask that each team member pays a monthly Community Fee.

Currently, this Community Fee is set to **7% of a team member's income**. This means the actual amount will fluctuate month-to-month depending on one's financial support.

The following are ways in which this money is used:

* YWAM Japan National Office monthly fee (¥1000 per team member)
* Fund to purchase a building (for offices, meetings, school lectures, and public worship etc.)
* Emergency fund (disaster relief, sudden team member expenses such as needing to fly home for family reasons etc.)
* Ministry events
* Admin costs (printing, website, office supplies etc.)
* Purchasing shared assets (computer, projector, instruments, vehicle etc.)
* Community meeting supplies (coffee, snacks etc.)
* Future vehicle & building maintenance

Please feel free to ask specific questions regarding this Community Fee. We want to be as transparent as possible in regards to community finances!

## Budgeting

Not everyone knows how to, or has experience with, budgeting. Not only do we want to be good stewards of the money God is entrusting us with, but it is also practically helpful to budget and keep track of our finances.

We encourage all of our team members to set monthly budgets and to record income and expenses.

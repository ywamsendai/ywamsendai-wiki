# Japanese Language Introduction

As we want to reach the Japanese people with the gospel and speak heart-to-heart, we need to communicate fluently in Japanese. This is a high value for our community and we aim to transition YWAM Sendai to function bilingually in Japanese and English as soon as possible (though, as we are still in the early stages of pioneering YWAM Sendai, we currently function mostly in English).

Your first decision when it comes to learning the language will be what approach or method to use. There are many approaches out there, but they will roughly fall into the following categories:

Category | Level of self-motivation | Cost | Examples
--- | --- | ---
Self study | High | Low | Mass Immersion, LAMP
Guided self study | Medium | Medium | GPA
Directed study | Low | High | School

If you feel that you struggle with self-motivation and time management, you may want to explore going to a language school. There are multiple schools in Sendai, and we can help you with finding one that is right for you. You will need to raise extra financial support for this route as it tends to be rather expensive.

If you feel like you are very self-motivated and can manage your own time, we have put together some tips in this wiki as you will likely need a lot of help! **We think the best way to learn a new language is through immersion.**

Much of what we have is based on the fantastic research by redditor [SuikaCider](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuikaCider/) which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bRzVblKVOsQJjTc2PIi1Gbj_LrsJCkMkh0SutXCZdI/edit#). There are also heavy influences from the [Mass Immersion Approach](https://massimmersionapproach.com/) and [Tofugu's Learn Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/) guide.

In summary, here are stages you will go through as you learn the language:

1. [Stage 1 | Building a Foundation (Beginner)](language2.md) - gain familiarity through studying
2. [Stage 2 | Immersion (Intermediate)](language3.md) - explore native content
3. Stage 3 | Subconscious Learning (Advanced) - learning becomes a by-product from enjoying native content
4. Stage 2+ | Refining - realising and working on weak areas

If you are an incoming staff to Japan, please dedicate time to studying the language while you fundraise. **A good goal would be for you to be close to stage 2 when you come to Japan.** Completing stage 1 will help you to feel much more comfortable in Japanese-only settings and you can enjoy immersing yourself.

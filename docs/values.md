# Culture & Values

On this page we aim to state YWAM's Foundational Values, as well as to describe ways in which we can practically live them out in our community.

## 1. Know God

YWAM is committed to know God, His nature, His character and His ways. We seek to reflect who He is in every aspect of our lives and ministry. The automatic overflow of knowing and enjoying fellowship with God is a desire to share Him with others.

**Application:** We prioritise, both individually and corporately, spending time with God, contemplating who He is. We will never be too busy for this.

## 2. Make God known

YWAM is called to make God known throughout the whole world, and into every arena of society through evangelism, training and mercy ministries. We believe that salvation of souls should result in transformation of societies, thus obeying Jesus’ command to make disciples of all nations.

**Application:** We actively seek to share the love of God with the Japanese people through our words and actions in a way that they will understand.

## 3. Hear God’s voice

YWAM is committed to creating with God through listening to Him, praying His prayers and obeying His commands in matters great and small. We are dependent upon hearing His voice as individuals, together in team contexts and in larger corporate gatherings as an integral part of our process for decision making.

**Application:** We will give God room to speak through each individual and allow our team members to act on what they feel God is saying. God needs to be a part of all decision making.

## 4. Practice worship and intercessory prayer

YWAM is dedicated to worship Jesus and engage in intercessory prayer as integral aspects of daily life. We also recognize the intent of Satan to destroy the work of God and we call upon God’s power and the Holy Spirit to overcome his strategies in the lives of individuals and in the affairs of nations.

**Application:** We will have regular times of worship and intercession, believing that these are the main ways we can bring real change.

## 5. Be visionary

YWAM is called to be visionary, continually receiving, nurturing and releasing fresh vision from God. We support the pioneering of new ministries and methods, always willing to be radical in order to be relevant to every generation, people group, and sphere of society. We believe that the apostolic call of YWAM requires the integration of spiritual eldership, freedom in the Spirit and relationship, centered on the Word of God.

**Application:** Right from the beginning, we have a desire to pioneer new ministries and new communities throughout Tohoku. We want to give our team members the freedom they need to persue these things, while keeping accountable to the community.

## 6. Champion young people

YWAM is called to champion youth. We believe God has gifted and called young people to spearhead vision and ministry. We are committed to value them, trust them, train them, support them, make space for them and release them. They are not only the Church of the future; they are the Church of today. We commit to follow where they lead, in the will of God.

**Application:** Age does not matter in YWAM Sendai. We will particularly aim our ministries at young people believing that they are the ones that will transform this country.

## 7. Be broad-structured and decentralized

YWAM is broad-structured and diverse, yet integrated. We are a global family of ministries held together by shared purpose, vision, values and relationship. We believe that structures should serve the people and the purposes of God. Every ministry at every level has the privilege and responsibility of accountability to a circle of elders.

**Application:** We function in circles, accountable to circle leads. As well as this, all of our circles are accountable to the national elders within Japan. We will make decisions that will move forward these YWAM Foundational Values.

## 8. Be international and interdenominational

YWAM is international and interdenominational in its global scope as well as its local constituency. We believe that ethnic, linguistic and denominational diversity, along with redeemed aspects of culture, are positive factors that contribute to the health and growth of the mission.

**Application:** We aim to be ethnically diverse as all cultures have something special to add to the Kingdom of God. As well as this, we aim to integrate godly Japanese culture into our community in order to better communite the gospel in a way the Japanese will understand as not being just a "foreign religion".

## 9. Have a biblical Christian worldview

YWAM is called to a biblical Christian worldview. We believe that the Bible makes a clear division between good and evil; right and wrong. The practical dimensions of life are no less spiritual than the ministry expressions. Everything done in obedience to God is spiritual. We seek to honor God with all that we do, equipping and mobilizing men and women of God to take roles of service and influence in every arena of society.

**Application:** We have a high value for Biblical fluency and to place the truth of the Word before any of the cultures represented within our community, including the Japanese culture.

## 10. Function in teams

YWAM is called to function in teams in all aspects of ministry and leadership. We believe that a combination of complementary gifts, callings, perspectives, ministries and generations working together in unity at all levels of our mission provides wisdom and safety. Seeking God’s will and making decisions in a team context allows accountability and contributes to greater relationship, motivation, responsibility and ownership of the vision.

**Application:** As we function in defined circles, in defined roles, there will be no room to do things outside of teams. That being said, circles provide relationship, prayer and accountability to each role, but never control.

## 11. Exhibit servant leadership

YWAM is called to servant leadership as a lifestyle, rather than a leadership hierarchy. A servant leader is one who honors the gifts and callings of those under his/her care and guards their rights and privileges. Just as Jesus served His disciples, we stress the importance of those with leadership responsibilities serving those whom they lead.

**Application:** We have no leadership hierarchy, but instead encourage all of our team members to practice servant leadership. The primary role of a circle lead is also one of servanthood, not of control.

## 12. Do first, then teach

YWAM is committed to doing first, then teaching. We believe that firsthand experience gives authority to our words. Godly character and a call from God are more important than an individual’s gifts, abilities and expertise.

**Application:** In order to reach the Japanese or to influence Japanese church, we need to first model what we want to see reproduced. Also, roles will not be assigned solely based on abilities, but by the leading of the Holy Spirit.

## 13. Be relationship-oriented

YWAM is dedicated to being relationship-oriented in our living and working together. We desire to be united through lives of holiness, mutual support, transparency, humility, and open communication, rather than a dependence on structures or rules.

**Application:** We have a value to build community based on relationship and enjoying life together first, before the practical outworkings of the community and ministry. Practical roles will not be tied to individuals and will be fluid and considered separate.

## 14. Value the individual

YWAM is called to value each individual. We believe in equal opportunity and justice for all. Created in the image of God, people of all nationalities, ages and functions have distinctive contributions and callings. We are committed to honouring God-given leadership and ministry gifts in both men and women.

**Application:** Each team member will be valued equally and will be given roles based on both ability and calling.

## 15. Value families

YWAM affirms the importance of families serving God together in missions, not just the father and/or mother. We encourage the development of strong and healthy family units, with each member sharing the call to missions and contributing their gifts in unique and complementary ways.

**Application:** We encourage both parents of children to take equal responsibility in child-raising and ministry.

## 16. Practice dependence on God

YWAM is called to practice a life of dependence upon God for financial provision. For individuals and YWAM corporately this comes primarily through His people. As God has been generous toward us, so we desire to be generous. YWAMers give themselves, their time and talents to God through the mission with no expectation of remuneration.

**Application:** Nobody in YWAM Sendai recieves a salary from YWAM Sendai and all of our team members will be expected to raise at least a certain level of monthly support, though through prayer and relationship rather than earning it.

## 17. Practice hospitality

YWAM affirms the ministry of hospitality as an expression of God’s character and the value of people. We believe it is important to open our hearts, homes and campuses to serve and honour one another, our guests and the poor and needy, not as acts of social protocol, but as expressions of generosity.

**Application:** We want to practice Japanese hospitality in our community: to serve those we don't know and make all feel welcome at our events and homes.

## 18. Communicate with integrity

YWAM affirms that everything exists because God communicates. Therefore, YWAM is committed to truthful, accurate, timely and relevant communication. We believe good communication is essential for strong relationships, healthy families and communities, and effective ministry.

**Application:** We want to over-communicate rather than under-communicate. One practical thing is to document as much as we can and make it avaliable to all via this wiki, and to be easily reached via Riot!
